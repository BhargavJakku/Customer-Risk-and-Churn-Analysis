# Customer-Risk-and-Churn-Analysis

Customer churn analysis refers to the practice of studying and understanding the rate at which customers leave doing business with a firm or discontinue utilizing its products or services. Since keeping current customers is frequently more economical than bringing in new ones, customer churn, also referred to as customer loss or retention, is an important statistic for organizations.
Finding patterns, trends, and contributing reasons to customer churn is the aim of customer churn analysis. Businesses may lower turnover and increase customer retention by being aware of the reasons why customers depart.
