# Customer-Risk-and-Churn-Analysis

Customer churn analysis refers to the practice of studying and understanding the rate at which customers leave doing business with a firm or discontinue utilizing its products or services. Since keeping current customers is frequently more economical than bringing in new ones, customer churn, also referred to as customer loss or retention, is an important statistic for organizations.
Customer churn analysis aims to find patterns, trends, and contributing reasons for customer churn. Businesses may lower turnover and increase customer retention by being aware of why customers depart. 

The project consists of various data analysis stages like collection, gathering, and analysis of the Customers of the Banking organization.
Some key concepts that are used are Exploratory Data analysis, feature engineering, Root cause analysis, Machine learning (Classifications), Data visualizations, and data-driven decision-making.
